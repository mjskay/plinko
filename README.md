`plinko` is an R package for creating animated Plinko boards (as known
as Galton boards, quincunxes, or bean machines). It helps determine
Plinko board parameters and generates plausible paths through a Plinko
board that result in a desired sample or set of quantiles, then renders
the Plinko board as an animated GIF or video.

## Installation

You can install plinko with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mjskay/plinko")
```

## Example

TBD
