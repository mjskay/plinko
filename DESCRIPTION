Description: Create animated Plinko boards (as known as Galton boards, 
    quincunxes, or bean machines). Helps determine Plinko board parameters
    and generates plausible paths through a Plinko board that result in a
    desired sample or set of quantiles, then renders the Plinko board as
    an animated GIF or video.
